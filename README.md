TensorFlow.js website || TensorFlow.js GitHub

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial
intelligence. It can be used for a range of tasks, but has a particular focus on training
and inference of deep neural networks.
TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use in research
and production. Google released the updated version TensorFlow 2.0 to the public in
September 2019.
TensorFlow can be used in a wide variety of programming languages, including Python,
JavaScript, C++, and Java.

Usage
TensorFlow serves as a core platform and library for machine learning. TensorFlow's
APIs use Keras to allow users to make their own machine learning models. In addition to
building and training their model, TensorFlow can also help load the data to train the
model, and deploy it using TensorFlow Serving.
TensorFlow.js
TensorFlow also has a library for machine learning in JavaScript. Using the provided
JavaScript APIs, TensorFlow.js allows users to use either Tensorflow.js models or
converted models from TensorFlow or TFLite, retrain the given models, and run on the
web.
TFLite
TensorFlow Lite has APIs for mobile apps or embedded devices to generate and deploy
TensorFlow models. These models are compressed and optimized in order to be more
efficient and have a higher performance on smaller capacity devices.
TFX
TensorFlow Extended (abbrev. TFX) provides numerous components to perform all the
operations needed for end-to-end production. Components include loading, validating,
and transforming data, tuning, training, and evaluating the machine learning model, and
pushing the model itself into production.
Applications
Medical
GE Healthcare used TensorFlow to increase the speed and accuracy of MRIs in
identifying specific body parts. Google used TensorFlow to create DermAssist, a free
mobile application that allows users to take pictures of their skin and identify potential
health complications. Sinovation Ventures used TensorFlow to identify and classify eye
diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans.

Twitter implemented TensorFlow to rank tweets by importance for a given user, and
changed their platform to show tweets in order of this ranking. Previously, tweets were
simply shown in reverse chronological order. The photo sharing app VSCO used
TensorFlow to help suggest custom filters for photos.
Search Engine
Google officially released RankBrain on October 26, 2015, backed by TensorFlow.[74]
Education
InSpace, a virtual learning platform, used TensorFlow to filter out toxic chat messages in
classrooms. Liulishuo, an online English learning platform, utilized TensorFlow to create
an adaptive curriculum for each student. TensorFlow was used to accurately assess a
student's current abilities, and also helped decide the best future content to show based
on those capabilities.
Retail
The e-commerce platform Carousell used TensorFlow to provide personalized
recommendations for customers. The cosmetics company ModiFace used TensorFlow to
create an augmented reality experience for customers to test various shades of make-up
on their face.
Research
TensorFlow is the foundation for the automated image-captioning software DeepDream.
